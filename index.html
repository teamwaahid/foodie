                    <h3>What guarantees freshness for the products ordered?</h3>
                    <p>Foodie strives to deliver the products that are fresh and systems are kept in place to source the
                        best products and safely consign them to you. We don't stock the products but place once we
                        receive orders. Even though we don't deny that it involves time we at Foodie believe that
                        centralising the whole despatch process would lead to economies of scale and allow quality check
                        , aggregating the products would add value to the customers.</p>

                    <h3>Can I place bulk orders?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. You can place bulk orders for any products that are available in Foodie.com. You can place
                        your bulk orders by dropping a mail to sales@foodie.com.</p>

                    <h3>How about packing?</h3>
                    <p>We at Foodie strive to deliver the best product and in that endeavour we accept no compromises.
                        As far as packing is concerned we have received feedback from our customers stating that the
                        outer packing is done in a carton box and the look is not proportionate to the order size. We
                        take this as a complement and the reason is we do not want any amount of rough handling to
                        affect the quality, taste, look or texture of the food item in any case.</p>

                    <h3>How is the packing done to my order?</h3>
                    <p>Packing is our extreme concern. We take all steps to have your products delivered in a pucca and
                        hygienic condition without any damage.</p>
